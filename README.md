## Formats & Files

### Splits
- In addition to the Splitter-native `.split` format, the app can import the following:
	- Splits.io Exchange Format (`.json`)
	- LiveSplit (`.lss`)
	

The app can also export to `.json`, and exporting to `.lss` will come in a future build 
Support for additional formats is currently underway 

### Hotkeys
- Hotkeys are stored in `~/Library/Application Support/Splitter/splitter.splitKeys`, with a `.json` file for each configured hotkey. 
	- Note: If the filenames are changed, the app wonâ€™t recognize it.
