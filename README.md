## Supported Formats

[Info about Splitter's native file format](https://github.com/MichaelJBerk/Splitter/wiki/.Split-Format)

- In addition to the Splitter-native `.split` format, the app can edit and save the following:
	- LiveSplit (`.lss`)

The app can also import/export to `.json` (as the Splits.io Exchange Format). The ability to edit `.json` directly (w/o needing to import/export) will come in a future build.

Support for additional formats (including Llanfair and TimeSplitTracker) is currently planned, as well.
