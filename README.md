## Discussion 

You can suggest features, report issues, and contribute to the overall discussion about Splitter on the official [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/S6zCHYq). 

## Supported Formats

[Info about Splitter's native file format](https://github.com/MichaelJBerk/Splitter/wiki/.Split-Format)

In addition to the Splitter-native `.split` format, the app can edit and save the following:
	- LiveSplit (`.lss`)
	- Splits.io (`.json`)
	
Note that some features (such as appearance and color settings) are only saved to a `.split` file. As such, if you don't want to have to set them every time you open the file, it's recommended to save the file as `.split` (by clicking "File" -> "Save as..." in the menubar). If you need to need to share it with someone who isn't using Splitter, just open the `.split` file, and save it in whatever other format works best.  
	
## Building Splitter
If you want to build Splitter yourself:
- Clone this repo
- run `pod install` in the project's root directory
	- If prompted for keys, just type in whatever you like and press enter. It won't make a difference to you
- Open Splitter.xcworkspace in Xcode

Note that you'll need to have Cocoapods and Cocoapods-keys installed to build the project
