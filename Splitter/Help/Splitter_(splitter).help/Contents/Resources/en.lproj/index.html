<p>This is a (mostly) blank project, and this is its landing page.</p>

<p>There are a few sample groups already set up, and some of the sample pages
demonstrate the basic features of Apple’s help system and Middlemac’s helpers.</p>

<hr />

<p>This project includes a few sample pages in another locale, and as such a
language selector should be available below, <em>if</em> this page is viewed in a
browser.</p>
