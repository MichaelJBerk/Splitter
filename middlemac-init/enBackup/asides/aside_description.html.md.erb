==============================

Apple’s modern Help Books use a feature call an “aside” to show short bits of
information that can be referenced in the current page without having to load
a new page.

Note that the source frontmatter for this page indicates a layout of
`layout-apple-modern-aside`, which should be used for asides because they
contain extra metadata need for this feature to work.

Because these asides are separate HTML files, they can be re-used in multiple
locations throughout your project.
