Because there's no chapter (this file is not in a group), there's no chapter
heading.

The item below represents the `helpbook_task` helper being used. Because there
is only a single task on this page, it is present statically without a
disclosure button to reveal and hide it.

<% helpbook_task "hello_world_lorem", "Lorem", :markdown => true do %>
<%= lorem.paragraphs 3 %>
<% end %>
