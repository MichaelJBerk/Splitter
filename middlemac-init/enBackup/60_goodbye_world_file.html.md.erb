This is another page that uses some of _Middlemac_’s helpers so that Cucumber
testing can be performed. This sample project is also the fixture for testing;
if you have this Gem’s source, you can

~~~ bash
rake test
~~~

…from the Gem’s directory to run the tests yourself.

Note that this isn’t the only file tested, but it’s a nice place to capture
some of the test output.

Link Tag
--------

### Link to `hello_world_file.html`
Asked for `hello_world_file.html`. I expect an Apple HB link because the
given HTML file appears in the sitemap.

<%= link_to 'Hello World File', 'hello_world_file.html' %>

~~~
<%= link_to 'Hello World File', 'hello_world_file.html' %>
~~~


### Link to `page_one.html`
Asked for `page_one.html`. I expect an Apple HB link because the given HTML
file appears in the sitemap.

<%= link_to 'Page One', 'page_one.html' %>

~~~
<%= link_to 'Page One', 'page_one.html' %>
~~~


### Link to `page_two.html`
Asked for `page_two.html`. I expect an Apple HB link because the given HTML
file appears in the sitemap. However I'm not specifying the path to the
file, and there are multiple files with the same name, so which will I get?

<%= link_to 'Page Two', 'page_two.html' %>

~~~
<%= link_to 'Page Two', 'page_two.html' %>
~~~


### Link to `page_two.html` again.
Asked for `page_two.html`. I expect an Apple HB link because the given HTML
file appears in the sitemap. This time I'm specifying a path to the page_two
that I actually want.

<%= link_to 'Page Two Again', 'sample_group_number_two/page_two.html' %>

~~~
<%= link_to 'Page Two Again', 'sample_group_number_two/page_two.html' %>
~~~


### Link to `doesnt_exist.html`
Asked for `doesnt_exist.html`. Because the file doesn't exist in the sitemap,
it will be handled as a normal link.

<%= link_to 'Doesn’t exist', 'doesntexist.html' %>

~~~
<%= link_to 'Doesn’t exist', 'doesntexist.html' %>
~~~


### Link to `page_four.html`
