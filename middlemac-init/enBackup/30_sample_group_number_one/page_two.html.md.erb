blurb:  Here are some writers, added using Middleman’s `data` system.
order: 20

<%= current_page.data.blurb %>

- Because this page is part of the “Sample Group Number One,” Apple’s help
  system places this as a chapter heading at the top of this page.

- Note that this page number is defined by frontmatter, and _not_ by prefixing
  the file name.
  
Sample Works
------------

The table below is a nice markdown table with Apple’s CSS.



<% data.globals.famous_writers.each do |writer| %>
| <%= writer.author %> | <%= writer.sample_work %>
<% end %>


Sample Works as a `<DL>`
---------------------------

Here's the data again as a definition list. Apple’s default style is horribly
broken, so _Middlemac_ reimplements it similar to Apple’s table style.

<% data.globals.famous_writers.each do |writer| %>
<%= writer.author %>
: <%= writer.sample_work + "\n"  %>
<% end %>
