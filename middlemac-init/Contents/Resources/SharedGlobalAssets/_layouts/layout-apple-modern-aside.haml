  This layout will be used for every aside portion of your help book. The key
  difference is that the meta robots prevents this page from being indexed,
  because it's not a free-standing page. Additionally, it's a good idea to
  assign your group-definition index files to this layout, as well, since
  they have no content and we donâ€™t want them indexed.
